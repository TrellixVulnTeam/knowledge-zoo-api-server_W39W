1. extract metadata used to re-format the info of the data extracted

2. https://androguard.readthedocs.io/en/stable/intro/gettingstarted.html
go to dir (C:\Users\caila\Desktop\FIT4003\androguard-master\venv-androguard\Scripts) and run (python androguard.exe <APK path>). It will run. Use a.get_permissions() and many others to get the permission information.

Android APIs hence should be the public methods in the SDK

0. focus on famous australian apps (around 10,000), Frank download
1. eliminate Ljava....in argument
3. method/package who use that API as attibute for API node (later on)


5. research proposal:
make it clear what is the motivation: what can benefit from it, what's it outcome: understand the mobile app, support faster search for android application (question answer), recommendation/correlation, compatibility(important); 
this is an interesting project and what we done can be useful for people

6. upload apk tool: json only send to Frank, I no need use my createNode python file to create a node for user's upload apk 

7. reschedule meeting, not here 26/9 - 1/10 for unigames

- friday meet write report
- run all json file send to frank


**- json file format save in .txt



JSON format
  # Order of JSON format is name, SHA256 hash, size, minSDKVersion, certificate(fingerprint), certificate(owner), permission


{"name": "asdasd",
"SHA256": "212313",
"versionCode": "21213",
"versionName": "21213",
"size": 123,
"minSDKVersion": "123",
"certificate(fingerprint)": "dsadasdasd",
"certificate(owner)": "dsadasdasd", < node
"permission": ["1","2","3","3"]
"API" : ["a","b","c"]
}


Fail:
TopTop4.0.3withads.apk
TPK.apk




neo4j:
1. delete node > MATCH (n:APK { name: 'Facebook' })
DELETE n
2. delete a node with all its relationships > MATCH (n { name: 'Andy' })
DETACH DELETE n
3. Delete relationships only > MATCH (n { name: 'Andy' })-[r:KNOWS]->()
DELETE r
4. create label > CREATE (p:Permission)
